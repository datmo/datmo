class Task():
    """Task is an entity object to represent an experiment run. A snapshot is taken before and after the task
    to capture the relevant components. These snapshots are flagged as temporary unless otherwise specified
    by the user but are stored as ids within the task object for reference.

    Note
    ----
    All attributes of the class in the ``Attributes`` section must be serializable by the DB

    Parameters
    ----------
    dictionary : dict
        id : str, optional
            the id of the entity
            (default is None; storage driver has not assigned an id yet)
        model_id : str

        session_id : str
            id of session associated with task
        command : str
            command that is used by the task
        before_snapshot_id : str, optional
            snapshot created before the task is run
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        ports : list, optional

            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        gpu : bool, optional
            boolean to signify if run requires gpu
            (default is False, which means no gpu unless specified)
        interactive : bool, optional
            boolean to signify if should be run in interactive mode
            (default is False, which means no interactive mode unless specified)
        task_dirpath : str, optional
            task directory path relative to the project root

            timestamp for the beginning time of the task
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        after_snapshot_id : str, optional
            snapshot created after the task is run
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        run_id : str, optional
            run id for the run (different from environment id and task id)
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        logs : str, optional
            string output of logs
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)

            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        results : dict, optional
            dictionary containing output results from the task
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)
        end_time : datetime.datetime, optional
            timestamp for the beginning time of the task
            (default is None, which means it isn't set yet)

            (default is datetime.utcnow(), at time of instantiation)
        updated_at : datetime.datetime, optional
            (default is same as created_at, at time of instantiation)
